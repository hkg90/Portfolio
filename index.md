## Welcome

I'm Denise Suter and welcome to my page. Video games are a huge passion of mine and I love transforming ideas into reality.  


### Background

I am a new graduate from Oregon State Univeristy and am currently pursuing a career in game development. Before this I worked in quality assurance in the biotech/ biopharma industry, but always felt unfulfilled in my role. I pivoted out of that and pushed myself to get a degree in computer science and graduated this year! I have always had a passion for game development and I love being able to create new immersive environments for players to get hooked in as I have with my favorite games in the past. Now I'm working to get my dream job of working in the gaming industry while continuing to make games in my free time. 

Beyond working I'm also a huge fan of traveling, finding great places to eat or taking my dog out for a fun adventure. My latest hobby is using my Oculus Quest 2 to try out new VR games, check out the new trending games and thinking about VR games I'd like to make as well. When I first started gaming I was so amazed by the open world in Runescape and the ability to become a master of whatever I wanted. Now the technology has grown so much since I first started gaming and it's inspiring to see VR games like A township Tale that allows players to do the same in VR and providing a completely new experience. I can't wait to see what's next and to be a part of creating that new experience for players.
